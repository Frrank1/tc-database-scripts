We will use (i,j) to denote the j-th cell in the i-th row (0-based indices). Each cell is initially white. You goal is to have a board that has at least one black cell in each row, and at the same time at least one black cell in each column.</p>

<p>You will paint the cells black in turns. In each turn, you select one cell (in a specific way that is given below) and color it black. You stop as soon as your goal is achieved.</p>

<p>You are given a <type>String[]</type> <b>prob</b> consisting of N elements, each M characters long. All characters in <b>prob</b> are digits ('0'-'9'). The digit represented by the j-th character in the i-th row (0-based indices) will be denoted p[i][j]. This digit is the relative probability of cell (i,j) being chosen in each turn.</p>

<p>Formally, let s be the sum of all p[i][j]. Then in each turn the cell (i,j) is chosen with probability p[i][j]/s. Note that the same cell may be chosen multiple times: we may sometimes choose a cell that is already black.</p>

<p>The constraints guarantee that achieving your goal is possible. Return the expected number of turns until your goal is achieved.</p></intro><spec></spec><notes><note escaped="1">Your return value must have a relative or an absolute error of less than 1e-9.</note></notes><constraints><user-constraint escaped="1"><b>prob</b> will contain between 1 and 21 elements, inclusive.</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">Each element of <b>prob</b> will be between 1 and 21 characters long, inclusive.</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">The elements of <b>prob</b> will be of the same length.</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">Each element of <b>prob</b> will consist of digits only ('0'-'9').</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">The total number of cells (i.e., the total number of digits in <b>prob</b>) will be between 1 and 150, inclusive.</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">In each row there will be at least one non-zero digit.</user-constraint><user-constraint escaped="1">In each column there will be at least one non-zero digit.</user-constraint></constraints><test-cases><test-case id="33121348" example="1"><input>{/ASCII34/10/ASCII34/,

<p>Then there will be some additional turns until the other cell is chosen. As that happens with probability 1/2, the expected number of additional turns is 2.</p>

<p>Then there will be some additional turns until some other cell is chosen for the first time. The probability of choosing a different cell is 3/4, thus the expected number of these additional turns is 4/3.</p>

<p>Now, what is the second cell to be colored black?</p>

<ul>
<li>With probability 1/3 it is the cell (1,1) and we are done.</li>
<li>With probability 2/3 it is one of the other two cells. In either of these two cases, we still need to color any one of the other two white cells black, and the expected number of turns until that happens is 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the answer is 1 + 4/3 + (2/3 * 2) = 11/3.</p>
